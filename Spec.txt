Snipe front run and also snipe presale
The bot currently works for pancake swap and uses wbnb, I will need to also use bnb and busd. Fees can be still paid in BNB like is it now
If you can add Uniswap and sushiswap to work with weth and USDC
Is it possible ? Also the front run module is not working very if you can check it and tell me what’s wrong.
Also. The presale on dx sale works on v2 but they update dx sale to v3 can you update the address there too? I will probably work with you for a long time if you can do these.

So it’s possible for you to add a cool interface instead of visual studio with same code still in Javascript?

Ok but will you add this also into interface ?
1: add bnb and busd on pancake
2: add sushi and uni ( to work with weth and USDC)
3: make dx sale v3 and if possible to detect countdown just with address
Let me show you

Let’s keep it in visual studio. Once all changes are done and everything. We can see after if add interface or not ok ?
Also , if you see the bot it has sell delay in seconds. Is it possible for you to set it at like set at x2 profits or at x5 and so on ?
